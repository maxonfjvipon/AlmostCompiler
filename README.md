# AlmostCompiler
 
### What it does 
1. Accepts file with C/C++ code (except some constructures, check below...)
2. Builds token table
3. Builds syntax tree
4. Converts syntax tree to assembler code (NASM) and write it to file

### C/C++ constructions that are no supported
1. OOP constructions
2. Input/Output functions and operators
3. Math operators that contains of 2 characters like ++, --, /=, ==, *= ect
4. Mb someting else :D

### How it can be used
I think it will be a good and clear explanation and how-to for guys, who want to write a compiler or want to understand how it truly works.
